# Password Generator Starter Code

In this challenge, I used the Javascript knowledge I learned this past week to create a script that will generate a random password from a custom set of characters chosen by the user. In this project, I utilized DOM Manipulation, looping, Window methods and Math methods, along with arrays and string concatenation.

The deployed application can be found at: [abhibiju.github.io/JavaScript-Password-Generator](https://abhibiju.github.io/JavaScript-Password-Generator/)

Here is what the website currently looks like:
